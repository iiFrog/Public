# 1. [PassGen] (https://github.com/iiFrog/Public/blob/main/PassGen) 
I worked on this off and on throughout a few weeks every time i would be bored in school. 
PassGen utilizes the random module in python to mash up lower, upper, number, and special characters into one password.
- Very roughly made to pass the boredom of every day class
- Includes Weak [3], Normal [7], and Strong [10]

~~Goals: To make it more personalizable in the future.~~

Completed on 1 - 15 - 2021
# 2. [PassSaver] (https://github.com/iiFrog/Public/blob/main/PassSaver)

My first ever actual Project. Saves it all to a .txt file :)

# 3. [PassMan] (https://github.com/iiFrog/Public/blob/main/PassMan)
A combination of both PassGen and PassSaver to create a Password Manager!

100% Functional and working as of 1-21-20
 
 #4. [QuadForm] (https://github.com/iiFrog/Public/blob/main/QuadForm)
 I made this during 7B today after realizing that in Algebra, there are many Formulas that are simply just plugging in numbers as the variables, and this can easily be done using Python.
