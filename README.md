# 1. [PassGen] (https://github.com/iiFrog/Public/blob/main/PassGen) 
I worked on this off and on throughout a few weeks every time i would be bored in school. 
PassGen utilizes the random module in python to mash up lower, upper, number, and special characters into one password.
- Very roughly made to pass the boredom of every day class
- Includes Weak [3], Normal [7], and Strong [10]

~~Goals: To make it more personalizable in the future.~~
